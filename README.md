# Lottery Project

## Useful commands:

- First, you need to apply following command to start proxy:
lcp --proxyUrl https://www.lottohelden.de/ 

- To run the project:
npm run serve

- To run tests:
npm run test:unit

## Notes:
- Since I barely needed class names, I haven't used BEM class naming convention for this project. I also wanted to avoid from adding extra class names since I was able to use "scoped" attribute. I am not sure if this was best practice though.
